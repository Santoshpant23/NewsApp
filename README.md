#NewsApp

Hello Everyone, 

This is a news app and I named it Project MonkeyNews. This is very simple, easy to use, your personal news website where you can keep yourself updated. I have used ReactJs to make this web application. To get the latest news, I have used a free API that only works on the local server. If you want to use this source code and make a website that everyone can access, you have to buy an API from API providers. Feel free to use this source code. 

Also, this website has some modern features like a loading bar at the top, just like Youtube has, and an infinite scroll which most of modern applications use, like Instagram, facebook, and more.
